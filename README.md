# Crack-Dectection-Using-Digital-Image-Processing
This is a small project in digital image processing that uses different set of Positive and Negative images to create a model. 

Positive image set is a set of 20000 images of different cracks on the bricks where the Negative set is a set of 20000 images of bricks with no cracks.

Using these images the model will be generated. By passing the test inages the model will execute and the final result will be generated as a CSV file.
